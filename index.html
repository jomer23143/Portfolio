									<p> Basketball is a sport that requires personal skill, team work and speed. Basketball is a great sport; I enjoy it even though I’m not really good on it. I learned to play basketball at young age because my father is a basketball player and I think that is one of the reason that’s why I been hook to play it.
									</p>
									<p> I have been also interested in basketball because it is a sport that helps to make you healthy because it could be a form of exercise that can burn some calories. Besides on playing basketball I also enjoy watching basketball especially NBA games.</p>
								</li>
								<li id="hobbies-details">Volleyball
									<p>When I play volleyball I feel healthy and stronger, besides I meet new people from the neighbor. I not only like playing volleyball but I also enjoy watching volleyball on T.V. when I go to the beach, my family and friends get together to play and we have a lot of fun. For me, volleyball is a part of my life and it means a lot to me. Currently I am trying to get in a team before the summer comes. It is so much fun to play with the ball. </p>
								</li>
								<li id="hobbies-details">Chess
									<p>It has been proven through observation and academic studies that playing chess can make you smarter. Chess is often called “the game of kings” because of its dominant history in the life of royalty. Chess was often played by kings and ranking military officers to help them make better decisions in the heat of battle. Kings also looked at chess as a way to practice political strategy in an abstract way</p>

							<h1 id="Hello">Hello,</h1>
							<h2 id="about">a bit about me:</h2>
							<p>
								Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
							</p>
							<p>
								I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read people’s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.
